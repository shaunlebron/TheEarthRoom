# The Earth Room

Knowledge becomes more meaningful when presented in a way that can be
experienced.  Thus, _The Earth Room_ is a proposed art installation whose goal is
to try to evoke for the general public the unfathomable experiences felt by
astronauts in space ([read their accounts][astronaut-quotes]).

- summarily: a place to go to see the world from above (in realtime)
- externally: a small, isolated building
- aesthetically: invoking an audio/visual/spatial presence
  - a dark, round standing theater
  - its center has a large hole, revealing a bottom floor with an upward facing screen
  - a realtime projection of the earth is shown on screen
  - visitors lean over the rails of the dimly lit surrounding aisle to peer down at the earth
  - a low hum of space noice
- technically: 
  - movie theater sized screen showing [ISS HD Earth] live stream
  - movie theater sized sound system playing [popular space sounds]

An alternative implementation could involve VR headsets for heightening a sense
of presence and realistic perspective.

## Inspiration

- [Rothko Chapel][rothko] - a silent, round art installation
- [Star-Spangled Banner Room][star-spangled] - a dark and ambient installation
- [A definition of 'awe' by Brian Moriarty][awe] - a call to create meaningful experiences within a medium
